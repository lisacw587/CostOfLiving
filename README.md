This project includes multiple ways of looking at cost of living and affordability. On the Java side, thereâ€™s a small console program with an AffordabilityCalculator that adds up common household expenses and checks whether an income can cover them. On the Python side, there is a Flask web app using Pandas and Plotly to load data from a database from the Economic Policy Institute and display it in interactive charts. Between the two, you can both crunch the numbers in Java and explore county-level data, through a browser.
